Hi DEVS!

This repository contains an API programmed in PYTHON - FLASK - MYSQL. Follow the command guide and use it! (Commands on macOS)

➜ API-FLASK---PYTHON--MYSQL ~ pip install virtualenv

This command installs the virtualenv package, which is a tool used to create isolated Python environments.
➜ API-FLASK---PYTHON--MYSQL ~ python3 -m virtualenv venv

This command creates a virtual environment named "venv" using Python 3. It isolates the project's dependencies from the global Python environment.
➜ API-FLASK---PYTHON--MYSQL ~ source venv/bin/activate

This command activates the virtual environment. Activating the virtual environment ensures that the subsequent Python-related commands are executed within the isolated environment.
➜ API-FLASK---PYTHON--MYSQL ~ pip install -r "requirements.txt"

This command installs the dependencies listed in the "requirements.txt" file. These dependencies are necessary for the proper functioning of the Flask API with MySQL. Make sure to replace "requirements.txt" with the correct path if it's located elsewhere.
Make sure to follow these commands in the specified order to set up and activate the virtual environment and install the required dependencies for the Flask API.
